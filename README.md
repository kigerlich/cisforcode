# cisforcode

A coding challenge solved by Kaleigh Gerlich.

1) Created the "C" shaped layout in HTML/CSS

2) Wrote jQuery/javascript so that clicking the large white boxes turns them blue. After the last white box has been clicked, the green box turns red and the blue boxes start "undoing" their blue coloring in the reverse order that they were clicked, separated by 1 second. Nothing responds to clicks during this period. After all the blue boxes are white once again, the red box turns green.
